# Neural_nastya

Neural network that is created to talk with people via telegram bot

model is based on Sberbank's(Russian bank) Russian gpt-3 model

To get started you need to copy repository from github to your working directory with
`<git clone https://github.com/sberbank-ai/ru-gpts>`

Then install all required packages with
`<pip install -r ru-gpts/requirements.txt>`

And the only thing left to do is edit main.py file with your own values (bot token, your telegram id)

And when it's done, when you installed all the packages, changed the file and did all need work you can start main.py

#####Carefully! I used GPT3Large So it takes 3.14 gb on your disk and takes about 7 Gb RAM so make sure you have this space!
